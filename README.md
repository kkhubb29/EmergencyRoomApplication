# Triage for Walk-in ER Patients
## a program to help organize patients based on their injuries and ailments 


For my term project, I propose to create a project that can be used in ER waiting rooms. The application will allow the 
ER coordinator to order, sort and prioritize walk-in ER patients. The application will have two elements. The first will 
be a digital questionnaire that will be filled out by patients as they arrive in the ER. The second element will be a 
list of patients created using the information from the form that will be used by the coordinator in the ER to determine 
how each patient is processed.

A score will be calculated for each patient based on the answers to the questionnaire.  Patients will be assigned one of 
three states based on their score:
- in waiting room
- assigned to a doctor
- assigned to a nurse practitioner 

This project interests me because I once waited a long time in an emergency room with a sprained ankle and wondered how 
they decided who to deal with next

For **phase 1**, I am going ot focus on a patient being able to enter their name and the ER coordinator being able 
to manipulate the list and to assign them.

I will introduce scoring and the questionnaire at a later phase. 

##User Stories:
- As a user *(patient)*, I want to be able to add my name to the ER patient list.
- As a user *(ER coordinator)*, I want to be able to view the list of patient and their current assignments.
- As a user *(ER coordinator)*, I want to be able to assign patients to a doctor
- As a user *(ER coordinator)*, I want to be able to assign patients to a nurse practitioner
- As a user *(ER coordinator)*, I want to be able to add and remove patients from the ER patient list.
